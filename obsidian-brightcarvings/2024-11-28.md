#people #teams 
Spoke to Jason yesterday and he's still very interested in coming back part time to Nine in his final year.
We have a job ad currently approved and running that I have encouraged Raunak to apply for to take her from associate platform engineer to platform engineer and ideally get her a suitable salary increase as part of the responsibility shift.
The job has been approved with a requested new base salary of $140K
