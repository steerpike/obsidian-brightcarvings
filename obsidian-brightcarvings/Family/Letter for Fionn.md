My darling Fionn,
As you close one chapter and begin another I wanted to tell you how immensely proud of you I am. Watching you grow from my beautiful boy into the remarkable young man youâ€™re becoming has been one of the greatest joys of my life. You have a curious mind, a thoughtful heart and a wicked sense of humour. I hope you never lose your love of sharing stories and laughter with everyone around you.

I hope that as you begin your new adventure in high school, you carry with you the memories of the formative journey you shared with Eva and your peers at Aurora. The gentle guidance, encouragement, and support you gave one another have been invaluable, and I hope they remain a source of strength and inspiration as you all step into the exciting uncertainties that lie ahead.
