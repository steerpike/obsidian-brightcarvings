There is a small number of essential underlying building blocks. These can be summarised as: “the black box”; POSIWID (“the purpose of a system is what it does”); and the law of requisite variety.

The first of these is about the behaviour of a complex system.  Often you can’t tell what a complex system is doing, and trying to take it apart (as if it is, instead, a complicated system) will not help you. Therefore you have to treat it as a black box. You know what the inputs are and you know what the outputs are, even if you don’t know what happens between those two points.

The second: Because you don’t know what’s going on inside the black box, you need to assume that the system is designed to produce the outcomes it produces, even if those are not what those in charge of it say they are doing.

the third: Systems/organisms must have a number of control mechanisms or responses which are at least equal to, or greater than, the number of potential disturbances/challenges that the systems must face.
