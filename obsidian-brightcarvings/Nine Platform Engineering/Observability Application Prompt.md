Create the following set of applications that work with each other.
First create a client application using next.js that has a single landing page that displays as video that can be played.
The client application, before displaying the video makes a call to an identity service which is a separate application made in nest.js
the nest.js Identity application has a single API call which indicates a boolean for if the user is logged in or not. It accepts a mock parameter which can be used to force the API to return true or false for testing purposes.
Once the client has determined if the user is currently logged in or not it makes a call to a third application which is also a nest.js application that provides 1 video url to stream if the user is logged in and a second streaming url if the user is not logged in.
