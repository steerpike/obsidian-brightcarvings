Create the following set of applications that work with each other.
Create a folder called simple-app that itself contains three separate applications
The first is a client application called simple-app-client using next.js that has a single landing page that displays as video that can be played.
The second app is called simple-app-identity and the client application, before displaying the video makes a call to an identity service which is a separate application made in nest.js
The nest.js Identity application has a single API call which returns a randomly generated NUID that represents the publicly identifiable id for a user for if the user is logged in or returns 0 if not. It accepts a mock parameter which can be used to force the API to return a NUID or 0 for testing purposes. The NUID used should be selected randomly from
Once the client has determined if the user is currently logged in or not it makes a call to a third application which is also a nest.js application called simple-app-api that provides 1 video url to stream if the user is logged in and a second streaming url if the user is not logged in.
