Declan has been one of the most influential contributors across the business since the moment he joined Nine. From pairing closely with Marc deBeer to define and build the next generation of compute platform that underpins Nine's development teams to his instrumental leadership in building out the resiliency and observability of Streaming's critical systems for the State of Origin and Olympics. Declan has been enthusiastic about promoting, mentoring and defining best practices, technical capabilities and development standards far beyond the previous normal scope of Platform Engineering. 
Declan has been warmly embraced by every single team he has interactions with. The number of people throughout the entire company who have provided glowing feedback around his personality, his drive and his expertise has proven time and time again that he's someone the company should warmly support and reward with a title the reflects his impact.
