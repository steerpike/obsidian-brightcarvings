For observability and monitoring, a foundational understanding of specific math concepts can enhance your ability to interpret data, identify patterns, and understand performance trends. Here’s a breakdown of helpful areas to focus on and accessible resources for each:

### 1. **Basic Statistics**

- **Why**: Helps with understanding metrics like averages, percentiles, and standard deviations, which are often used in dashboards and reports to represent system performance.
- **Topics to Cover**: Mean, median, mode, percentiles, variance, and standard deviation.
- **Resources**:
    - _Khan Academy’s Statistics and Probability Course_: Free, beginner-friendly.
    - _Crash Course Statistics_ on YouTube: Quick video summaries of statistical concepts.

### 2. **Probability**

- **Why**: Essential for understanding event likelihoods, error rates, and alert thresholds, especially when dealing with anomaly detection and alerting.
- **Topics to Cover**: Basic probability, conditional probability, and distributions (normal distribution is key).
- **Resources**:
    - _Introduction to Probability_ by MIT OpenCourseWare (Intro level, free).
    - _Coursera’s Data Science Math Skills_ by Duke University: Offers a quick overview of probability in practical contexts.

### 3. **Time Series Analysis**

- **Why**: Observability tools often track data over time (e.g., CPU load, memory usage). Time series analysis helps with recognising trends, seasonality, and outliers.
- **Topics to Cover**: Time series basics, trends, seasonality, and moving averages.
- **Resources**:
    - _Towards Data Science_: Many beginner articles on time series analysis.
    - _YouTube Channels_: StatQuest by Josh Starmer explains time series in an intuitive way.

### 4. **Logarithms and Exponentials**

- **Why**: Logarithmic scales are used in dashboards to make data easier to interpret, especially when data ranges are large.
- **Topics to Cover**: Basics of logarithmic and exponential functions, log scales.
- **Resources**:
    - _Khan Academy_: Great explanations and exercises.
    - _3Blue1Brown_ on YouTube: Visual explanations of exponential and logarithmic functions.

### 5. **Visual Data Interpretation**

- **Why**: Graphs are a key part of monitoring and observability. Understanding graph types and how to interpret them will help you draw insights more effectively.
- **Topics to Cover**: Types of charts (line charts, histograms, scatter plots) and interpreting graph patterns.
- **Resources**:
    - _Storytelling with Data_ by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic: Focuses on practical data visualisation techniques.
    - _DataCamp_ courses on Data Visualisation Basics: Interactive and beginner-friendly.

Starting with these fundamentals will make a noticeable difference in your ability to interpret observability data and understand performance metrics.
