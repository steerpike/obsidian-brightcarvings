The time I interviewed for a role at Riot Australia and they asked me to design a system for checking for bad language in forum posts and I tried to explain to them that this simply wasn't a technical problem. Not the right answer of course, and I really likely cost me the job, but I do still feel that I would't change my answer.
You can't police language. If people can't say what they intend in the clearest possible way then they'll find other ways to say those things which means that you're left policing more and more seemingly innocuous phrases because they are now used to *mean* something else entirely.
