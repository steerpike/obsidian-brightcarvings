#observability 
Putting aside the grand observability vision of wide events and a delightful UI with which to play with them we're still going to need to deal with the fact that large swathes of the business are just going to want to take massive piles of structured and unstructured logs and dump them somewhere with the intent to trawl through them for various bits of potentially useful information.
Security, Data, Video all create, or request from various vendors, massive amounts of logging data that they use for various purposes. We need some way of both storing that data in a way that doesn't bankrupt the company and exploring that data in a way that doesn't drive developers insane. Currently we don't have a great solution for either of these concerns.
