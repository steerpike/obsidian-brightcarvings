### Hiring  
#people #teams 

Jason Liu, our last intern, is interested in coming back to work for us 3 days a week during his final year of University. He's a excellent dev who was doing the work of a mid-level dev during the time we had him. 
We have a job ad currently approved and running that I have encouraged Raunak to apply for to take her from associate platform engineer to platform engineer and ideally get her a suitable salary increase as part of the responsibility shift.
The open role has been approved with a requested increased base salary of $140K (up from an original base salary of $116K) which when combined with Raunak's current base of $84K should allow for the possibility of hiring two mid-level devs at reasonably competitive salaries.
I think it's worth trying to retain both Raunak and Jason as excellent candidates for both the open role and the backfill of Raunak's position.
