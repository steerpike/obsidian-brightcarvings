Song for Fionn's class dinner:
May your troubles be less and your blessings be more
May nothing but happiness come to your door
And may you have love wherever you go
Your blessings outnumber the shamrocks that grow
May winds be at your back and sunshine overhead
May be friends be at your side wherever you are led
...Repeat again
